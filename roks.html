			A Blood pressure is the amount of force your blood uses to get through your arteries. When your heart pumps, it uses force to push oxygen-rich blood out to your arteries. They bring it to your body cells and tissues. If your blood pressure is too high, it can cause health issues. The only way to know your blood pressure is to measure it.

			<b>WHAT IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?</b>
	</P>
	<p align="left">
			*High blood pressure is often related to unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol, being overweight and not exercising enough.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
			*Left untreated, high blood pressure can increase your risk of developing a number of serious long-term health conditions, including coronary heart disease. You also risk damaging the blood vessels in your kidneys or eyes.
	</p>
	
	<p align="right">
			<b>WHAT IS LOW BLOOD PRESSURE?</b>
	</p>
	<p align="right">
			*Low blood pressure is less common. Some medicines can cause low blood pressure as a side effect. It can also be caused by a number of underlying conditions, including heart failure and dehydration.
	</p>
	<p align="right">
			*a reading of less than 90/60mmHg. It does not always cause symptoms, but you may need treatment if it does.

			<b>HOW IS BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURE?</b>
			<img src="pic4.jpg">
	<p>
		Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as 2 figures
	</p>
	<p>
		*systolic pressure- the pressure when your heart pushes blood out
	</p>
	<p>
		*diastolic pressure- the pressure when your heart rests between beats

		<b>WAYS TO CONTROL A NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE</b>
		<img src="pic3.jpg">
	</p>
	<p>
		*Exercise regularly- It's important to keep exercising to keep blood pressure from rising again. As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.
	</p>
	<p>
		*Lose extra pounds and watch your waistline- Weight loss is one of the most effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure. If you're overweight or have obesity, losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce blood pressure.
	</p>
	<p>
		*Reduce sodium in your diet- Even a small reduction of sodium in the diet can improve heart health and reduce high blood pressure.
	</p>
	<p>
		*Eat a healthy diet- Potassium in the diet can lessen the effects of salt (sodium) on blood pressure. The best sources of potassium are foods, such as fruits and vegetables, rather than supplements.
	</p>
	<p>
		*Get a good night's sleep- Poor sleep quality getting fewer than six hours of sleep every night for several weeks can contribute to hypertension.
